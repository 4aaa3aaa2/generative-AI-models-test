# generative-AI-models-test
Done 2023/09, DNN, GAN, VAE and Diffusion model are tested and compared here by generating some MNIST-like figures.  
The MNIST dataset is avaliable within Pytorch, and let the models learn it fitst and then generate something looks similar.
The code can be directly ran on google colab.
